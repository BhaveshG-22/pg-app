Promot :  Create a giant hyper-realistic statue based on the given photo, keeping the original face exactly the same without changes. The statue stands tall in the middle of a roundabout in Kolkata, near a famous historical landmark like the Howrah Bridge.
The statue is still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding, with many construction workers in yellow helmets and orange vests climbing, welding, and working on it. Parts of the statue's body are still exposed metal framework.
